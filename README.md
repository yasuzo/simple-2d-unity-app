# simple-2d-unity-app
This was made a year ago I'm just uploading it now because back then I didn't know what git was.

App was my final project in highschool. It is made in Unity with C#.

In this simple game, each round, a user is given a color and he has to tap as many falling squares as possible in a period of time.

Squares are randomly colored and generated in random positions.
